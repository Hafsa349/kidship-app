- Firebase JS SDK v9
- Firebase as the backend for email auth
- custom and reusable components
- custom hook to toggle password field visibility on a TextInput

- Login, Signup & Password Reset form built using Formik & yup
- show/hide Password Field's visibility üëÅ
- uses a custom Provider using Context API & Firebase's `onAuthStateChanged` handler to check the user's auth state with
- handles Forgot Password Reset using Firebase email method
- uses [Expo Vector Icons](https://icons.expo.fyi/)
- uses [KeyboardAwareScrollView](https://github.com/APSL/react-native-keyboard-aware-scroll-view) package to handle keyboard appearance and automatically scrolls to focused TextInput
- uses `dotenv` and `expo-constants` packages to manage environment variables (so that they are not exposed on public repositories)
- all components are now functional components and use [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)
